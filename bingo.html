        <h2>Problem and Context</h2>
        <div class="grid">
          <div>
            <h3 class="right-align">Designing for convention downtime</h3>
            <p>
              Convention attendees face significant downtime between panels,
              signings, and events. While they're eager to stay engaged with
              convention culture, there are limited structured activities that
              encourage exploration of the venue and interaction with the
              community. Existing solutions require attendees to passively wait
              or wander without clear direction or reward.
            </p>
            <p>
              I set out to design an experience that would give attendees a fun,
              low-pressure way to discover convention elements they might
              otherwise overlook while offering tangible incentives through
              real-life prizes at a Comic Con Bingo booth.
            </p>

            src="images/bingo-logo.webp"
            alt="Comic Con Bingo logo"
            class="img2 clickable"
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Understanding attendee needs</h3>
          <p>
            Since this was a conceptual class project without access to actual
            convention attendees, I developed a user need statement based on
            secondary research and my own observations at fan conventions. The
            core insight was that attendees want activities that align with
            their fandoms, provide clear goals, and don't require extensive
            commitment or coordination with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>From this, I identified three key user needs:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="three-group">
            <li>Accessible engagement that works during unpredictable gaps in schedules</li>
            <li>Social motivation through light competition without barriers to entry</li> 
            <li>Recognition and reward tied to convention culture</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Defining the Experience</h2>
        <div class="grid grid-left">
          <div>
            <h3 class="left-align">Mapping the game flow</h3>
            <p>
              I mapped out the full user flow to ensure the game mechanic would
              be intuitive and frictionless. Players would join an active game
              from the home screen and receive a randomly generated bingo card
              featuring convention-specific items (cosplayers, booths, signage,
              etc.). The challenge: photograph these items within a set time
              limit, turning the card into a timed scavenger hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
              When players tap a bingo square, a camera prompt appears, allowing
              them to either take a new photo or upload one from their library.
              This flexibility was important, as convention WiFi can be
              unreliable and attendees may capture images before formally
              joining a game. The first player to achieve five in a row wins
              prizes at a designated booth. Non-winners return to the home
              screen to join the next round, maintaining continuous engagement
              throughout the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              This structure balanced ease of use with competitive excitement
              and encouraged venue exploration without overwhelming users with
              complex rules or lengthy onboarding.
            </p>

            alt="User flow diagram for Comic Con Bingo"
            class="clickable"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="grid">
          <div>
            <h3 class="right-align">Visual design and mood</h3>
            <p>
              To establish the app's visual direction, I created a mood board
              that drew from comic book aesthetics: bold primary colors,
              halftone textures, comic-style illustrations, and pop culture
              references. The goal was to make the interface feel energetic and
              on-brand with convention culture while remaining legible and
              functional.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose vibrant colors commonly found in traditional comics and
              designed a logo in Adobe Photoshop that reinforced the playful,
              nostalgic tone. This visual language carried through to all
              subsequent design phases, ensuring the app felt cohesive and
              culturally relevant.
            </p>

        <h2>Wireframing & Iteration</h2>
        <div class="grid grid-left">
          <div>
            <h3 class="left-align">Initial sketches and explorations</h3>
            <p>
              I started with low-fidelity paper sketches to explore layout
              options and interaction patterns. At this stage, my priority was
              simplicity. I wanted to ensure that players of all tech literacy
              levels could understand the game mechanics at a glance.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img
            src="images/bingo-sketch.webp"
            alt="Early-stage lo-fi wireframe sketches"
            class="clickable"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="grid">
          <div>
            <h3 class="right-align">From sketches to refined wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              From there, I moved into medium-fidelity wireframes in Figma,
              refining the visual hierarchy and incorporating gestural
              interactions (tap to open camera, swipe to browse cards, etc.). I
              shared these with classmates and received feedback that informed
              adjustments to button sizing, prompt clarity, and flow
              transitions. For example, early iterations buried the camera
              prompt too deep; I revised the design to surface it immediately
              upon tapping a square.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img
            src="images/bingo-midfi.png"
            alt="Medium fidelity wireframes with gestures"
            class="clickable"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="grid grid-left">
          <div>
            <h3 class="left-align">High-fidelity design and prototype</h3>
            <p>
              The high-fidelity wireframes brought the mood board to life. I
              applied the comic-inspired color palette, incorporated the custom
              logo, and added subtle animations (button presses, card
              transitions) to enhance the sense of excitement and immersion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attention to micro-interactions was critical. For instance, when a
              player completes a row, a brief celebratory animation reinforces
              their win. When a round ends without a win, a friendly prompt
              invites them to try again. These details helped sustain engagement
              and emotional investment.

          <p>
            The final prototype brings together all design decisions, showcasing
            the full user experience from game entry to completion. The embedded
            Figma prototype below demonstrates a complete game loop: joining a
            game, photographing bingo items, submitting photos, winning or
            returning to the home screen, and repeating.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Acknowledging project limitations</h3>
          <p>
            As a class project, this concept wasn't validated with real users or
            tested in a live convention environment. I made design assumptions
            based on general UX principles and secondary research, but lacked
            direct feedback from the target audience. Additionally, I did not
            address backend considerations such as photo verification, prize
            distribution logistics, or scalability across different convention
            sizes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Key learnings and next steps</h3>
          <p>
            This project taught me the importance of anchoring design decisions
            in user context, even when working conceptually. By grounding every
            choice in the user need statement and imagined scenarios, I was able
            to create a cohesive experience that felt purposeful rather than
            arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned that clarity beats novelty. Early on, I experimented
            with more complex game mechanics (team modes, bonus challenges), but
            feedback and iteration revealed that simplicity would better serve
            users in a chaotic, distraction-filled environment like a convention
            floor.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I were to revisit this, I would prioritize testing with real
            attendees to uncover friction points I couldn't anticipate and
            explore how the app might integrate with existing convention
            infrastructure (badge scanning, official apps, sponsor
            partnerships). The visual design holds up well, but the true test
            would be whether it drives the exploration and engagement I designed
            it for.
