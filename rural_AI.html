        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            This project began with a broad question from our partner, the NTCA
            Rural Broadband Association:
            <em><strong>How can AI be deployed in rural spaces?</strong></em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Working collaboratively as a team of five, we narrowed our focus to
            food insecurity among older adults in rural Michigan, a population
            facing barriers of limited transportation, mobility challenges, and
            fragmented access to food assistance programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through 8 stakeholder interviews and external data analysis, we
            uncovered that the real challenge wasn't a lack of resources but a
            breakdown in communication between organizations. Our solution, an
            AI-powered resource platform paired with broadband partnership
            incentives, empowers food assistance networks to collaborate and
            scale their reach.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Nearly one-sixth of food-insecure households in the U.S. are in
            rural areas. In Michigan, 19.6% of the population is 65 or older,
            and 10.8% of seniors live in poverty. Food insecurity correlates
            strongly with chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, which
            disproportionately affect older adults in high-poverty counties.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Michigan has robust food assistance programs, many
            organizations operate in silos with limited funding and minimal
            staff capacity. Communication gaps prevent resources from reaching
            those who need them most.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Our Research Question</h3>
          <div class="callout">
            <img
              class="questionicon"

                  of food assistance organizations in rural Michigan so that
                  services and programs can best serve older adults in need?</em
                ></strong
              >
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            This question evolved through research. We initially considered
            individual-facing AI tools but pivoted after interviews revealed
            that organizational coordination was the real bottleneck.

        <div>
          <h3>Literature Review</h3>
          <p>
            We analyzed 35 sources covering Michigan demographics, food
            insecurity data, existing assistance programs, and AI applications
            in food systems. Key findings included the correlation between
            poverty and diabetes rates across counties and the fragmented nature
            of food distribution networks.

          <div class="grid">
            <div>
              <h3 class="right-align">External Data Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                Our team analyzed datasets from Data.gov, the U.S. Census, and
                USDA, including Income-to-Poverty Ratios and Senior Project
                FRESH program evaluations. Approximately 13% of surveyed
                individuals faced food insecurity, and 9% were unaware of
                available food resources.

            We conducted 8 interviews with food distribution managers, community
            educators, a health equity researcher, an AI expert in agriculture,
            an aging services representative, and a farmer. Interviews lasted 30
            minutes to 2 hours and were transcribed, then analyzed using
            affinity mapping in Figma.

          <li>
            <strong>Michigan has a thriving food economy</strong> with robust
            farming and distribution channels, but organizations struggle to
            maintain operations due to funding cuts, limited staffing, and lack
            of technology adoption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI adoption is minimal.</strong> Organizations prioritize
            basic operational needs over technology. Rural infrastructure often
            can't support advanced tools, and there's no evidence yet that AI
            provides tangible benefits for their specific contexts.

          <li>
            <strong
              >Open communication and collaboration are vital but
              underutilized.</strong
            >
            Food hubs connect over 75 pantries, but lack of coordination between
            producers, distributors, and buyers prevents efficient resource
            allocation. The digital divide also affects outreach, as older
            adults prefer traditional methods like phone hotlines over digital
            platforms.

        <h2>Strategic Pivot</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Our partner, Joshua Seidemann from NTCA, confirmed that shifting
            focus from individual-facing AI to organizational tools was the
            right move. His feedback gave us confidence to prioritize
            administrative efficiency and cross-organizational collaboration
            over consumer-facing apps.
          </p>
          <p>Based on research, we established four design recommendations:</p>
          <div class="small-grid">
            <p>
              <strong>Empower users without stigma.</strong><br />
              Respect the agency of older adults and farmers who prefer
              independence. Provide options and choices rather than prescriptive
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Map current services to identify gaps.</strong><br />
              Visualize existing resources to determine where rural areas need
              more support and build partnerships with current providers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Focus on organizations serving older adults.</strong
              ><br />
              Shift from designing for individuals to designing for the programs
              and staff who directly support them.

                connection.</strong
              ><br />
              Use AI for back-office tasks like data consolidation and resource
              matching, freeing staff to focus on relationship-based support.

        <div class="grid grid-left">
          <div>
            <h3 class="left-align">Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure our solution addressed real gaps in the market, we
              conducted a comparative nested matrix analysis of existing AI
              tools and food assistance platforms. We evaluated solutions across
              dimensions including ease of use, cost, organizational fit, and
              technical requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              This analysis revealed that while general AI tools exist, none
              were specifically designed for rural food assistance networks with
              limited technical capacity. Most required significant upfront
              investment or advanced technical expertise that small
              organizations couldn't provide.

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>An AI Resource Platform</h3>
          <p>
            We proposed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI platform that
            consolidates information from food programs across Michigan into a
            searchable, conversational interface. Unlike static databases, RAG
            models retrieve real-time, context-specific information from
            organizational knowledge bases, ensuring accurate and up-to-date
            responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            For organizations, it helps quickly locate partner resources, grant
            opportunities, and program eligibility criteria. For staff, it
            provides access to policy documents and service directories in one
            interface without administrative searching. For coordination, it
            identifies overlapping service areas, gaps in coverage, and
            opportunities for resource sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research shows RAG models in supply chain and social work contexts
            improve decision-making and reduce administrative burden, critical
            benefits for rural food systems with limited staff.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Broadband Partnership Incentives</h3>
          <p>
            To encourage adoption, we proposed partnering with broadband
            companies to offer discounts to organizations that contribute
            information to the platform. Organizations expand their outreach and
            share resources, while broadband companies grow their customer base
            in underserved rural areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform would be designed for desktop use, as most food
            assistance staff access professional tools via full-screen
            interfaces. It assumes stable internet access and basic digital
            literacy, which limits reach in areas with broadband gaps.

          <div class="small-grid">
            <p>
              <strong>Geographic Scope:</strong><br />
              Our research focused solely on rural Michigan. Infrastructure and
              policy conditions vary across rural U.S., requiring additional
              research for national scalability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Internet Access Assumptions:</strong><br />
              Our solution assumes organizations have stable internet and
              digital literacy, which isn't true for all rural communities. Some
              smaller pantries operate without internet access, limiting
              platform reach.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Underrepresented Stakeholders:</strong><br />
              Due to time and outreach constraints, we couldn't interview
              food-insecure older adults directly. We relied on second-hand
              accounts from program coordinators, which provided valuable
              insights but lacked the lived experience perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Feasibility Questions:</strong><br />
              Questions about long-term funding, server maintenance, and
              marketing remain unanswered. Addressing these would require
              perspectives from additional stakeholders we didn't have time to
              include.

            statement and incorporate recent policy changes like SNAP cuts,
            which we integrated into our final report.

            Our solution emerged directly from interview insights, not
            assumptions. The pivot from individual tools to organizational
            infrastructure only made sense because we listened to stakeholders
            who told us where the real pain points were.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the limited time for this research project and access
            to older adults to interview forced us to prioritize organizational
            efficiency over end-user apps. This constraint strengthened our
            solution by addressing systemic barriers rather than surface-level
            symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, using comparative nested matrices and usability scales
            helped us move beyond gut feelings to data-informed decisions about
            which solution would provide the most value with the least friction.

            If we had more time and resources, I would conduct usability testing
            with food assistance staff to validate the platform's interface. I
            would also interview older adults directly to understand their
            preferences for receiving information and prototype the RAG model
            with a pilot group of organizations to test real-world
            effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this project taught me that good UX research isn't about
            having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions,
            listening deeply, and designing solutions that acknowledge
            complexity rather than oversimplifying it. >
